# OneCase

By Lawrence Lin

This version of the project is not being maintained anymore and the code has been made public for anyone interested. This site is being hosted at https://theshowcase.app, feel free to make an account and give it a try. You can find my profile at https://theshowcase.app/lawlin. 

The current version of OneCase is being developed with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and AWS. You can find a working prototype of it at https://onecase.app/lawrence (give it a few seconds to load, it's being hosted on a free Heroku dyno that sleeps when not being used). Note that access to the current OneCase is limited to only viewing public pages, so if you would really like to try the site out, send me a message at lawrencelin101 'at' gmail 'dot' com.

# Setup

2. `cd` into the repository
3. Run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Use `npm start` to start the local server, a new browser window will open up. If it didn't, visit http://localhost:3000.
